## Big O Notation

- to analyze performance of the algorithm 
- high level understanding of the of time or space complexity of an algorithm
- does not care about precision only general trends
- the time or space complexity as measured by big O, only cares about the algorithm not anything like hardware 


## big o notation of built in data structures 

### objectives

- understand how objects and arrays work 
- plain why adding elements to the beginning of an array is costly
- compare and contrast the runtime for arrays and objects, as well as built-in methods 

## objects

- when you dont need order 
- fast lookups insertion and removal - constant timeo
- when you dont need things in order they are a good choice 

### operations
insertion O(1) 
removal O(1)
searching O(n)
access O(1)

### methods
- Object.keys - O(n)
- Object.values - O(n)
- Object.entries - O(n)
- hasOwnProperty - 0(1)
